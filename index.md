## About Me:
</span>
- I'm the youngest daughter of a family of four
- I do dance and I train 16 hours a week. These past few months I've been preparing for my dance studio's Nutcracker production and over the summer, I spent three weeks in Nashville training in Nashville Ballet's summer program. 
- I was born in Singapore and lived there until I was five years old. We moved to San Diego after my dad got a new job offer in Playstation IT, which sparked my interest in signing up for this course since my dad works in computer science.
- I've played the piano for ten years and I used to play the viola for about four years. 
- I listen to music a lot, and my favorite music style is R&B. A few months ago, I got to go to my favorite artist, Daniel Caesar's concert in Petco Park.
