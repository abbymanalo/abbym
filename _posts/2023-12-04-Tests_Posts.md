# All things Christmas *à©ˆðŸŽ„âœ©â€§â‚Š
<span style="font-size: 20px;">
In light of the holiday season approaching, here are some of my favorite things I like to do during the Christmas season that I reccomend!

- Listening to Chrtistmas music

    My personal favorite Christmas songs would be Last Christmas by Wham!, Underneath the Tree by Kelly Clarkson, and Santa Tell Me by Ariana Grande. Here's a video/link of Last Christmas:
