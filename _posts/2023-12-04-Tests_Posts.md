# All things Christmas *à©ˆðŸŽ„âœ©â€§â‚Š
<span style="font-size: 20px;">
In light of the holiday season approaching, here are some of my favorite things I like to do during the Christmas season that I reccomend! 

<span style="font-size: 18px;">
- Listening to Chrtistmas music

    My personal favorite Christmas songs would be [**Last Christmas**](https://open.spotify.com/track/2FRnf9qhLbvw8fu4IBXx78?si=db090f8487214019) by Wham!, [**Underneath the Tree**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3YZE5qDV7u1ZD1gZc47ZeR?si=7a8caf27a2dd4b23) by Kelly Clarkson, and [**Santa Tell Me**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0lizgQ7Qw35od7CYaoMBZb?si=c85f81a0a7314580) by Ariana Grande. 
    You can click on the bolded text to open the song in Spotify

- Watching Christmas movies

    **A Charlie Brown Christmas** is a classic Christmas movie to watch!
